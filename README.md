# Hand Sign Classification

## Introduction  
This project intends to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of hands based on how many fingers the hand is holding up. We initially use a dataset from Kaggle for training and testing, and then attempt to apply the model to new, less uniform data that may encountered in the real world.
